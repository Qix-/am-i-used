am-i-used
=========
A little toy script, written as fast as possible (and with very smelly
incomplete code), which scrapes the NPM website for an author's packages and
then queries the NPM API to check the number of downloads each of the packages
had last month.

License
=======
This code is licensed under the "DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO" license, so...
yeah.
